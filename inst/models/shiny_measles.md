# Modeling Measles in Schools

This model simulates measles outbreaks in schools and compares **how many fewer cases a quarantine procedure yields**. You can specify the number of people in the school (population size), the number of initial cases, the proportion of vaccinated agents, and the simulation duration in days. 

Note that the model only simulates outbreaks within a single school and does not include transmissions that come into the school from external sources (e.g., other schools, the community, etc.). Learn more about the model at <https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/epiworld-measles>.
