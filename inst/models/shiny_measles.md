# Modeling Measles in Schools

Using this app, you can simulate measles outbreaks in schools and compare **how many fewer cases a quarantine procedure yields**. You can specify the number of people in the school (population size), the number of initial cases, the proportion of vaccinated agents, and the simulation duration in days.
