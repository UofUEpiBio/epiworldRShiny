# Measles Model

Using this app, you can simulate measles outbreaks and compare **how many fewer cases a quarantine procedure yields**. You can specify the number of people (population size), the number of initial cases, the proportion of vaccinated agents, and the duration in days. You can learn more about the model at <https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/epiworld-measles>.
