## Measles Model

This model implements a time-discrete Agent-Based Model [ABM] with perfect mixing. The model starts with the introduction of one or more infected individuals. Depending on the vaccination rate, the model simulates the spread of the disease through a population of agents. The model includes a quarantine process that is triggered when an agent is detected in the rash period. You can learn more about the model at <https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/epiworld-measles>.
