## Measles Quarantine Model

This model implements a time-discrete Agent-Based Model [ABM] with perfect mixing. The model starts with the introduction of one or more infected individuals. Depending on the vaccination rate, the model simulates the spread of the disease through a population of agents. The model includes a quarantine process that is triggered when an agent is detected in the rash period. The model includes the following parameters:

- **Contact rate**: Contact rate  .
- **Transmission rate**: Transmission rate.
- **Vax efficacy**: Vaccine reduction in susceptibility.
- **Vax improved recovery**: Vaccine reduction in recovery rate.
- **Incubation period**: Incubation period.
- **Prodromal period**: Prodromal period.
- **Rash period**: Rash period.
- **Days undetected**: Days undetected.
- **Hospitalization rate**: Hospitalization rate.
- **Hospitalization days**: Hospitalization duration.
- **Vaccination rate**: Vaccination rate.
- **Quarantine days**: Quarantine days for vaccinated.
- **Quarantine willingness**: Quarantine success rate.
