# Example 2: Implementing vaccine and school closure

## Running the application
To run the epiworldRShiny application, first ensure that the package is
installed and loaded using the following code. To launch the application, 
use call the function, epiworldRShiny(). 
```{r running-the-app}
# install.packages("epiworldRShiny")
library(epiworldRShiny)
# epiworldRShiny()
```

## Model set-up
  
This example features the implementation of the vaccine and school closure 
interventions to curb disease spread. All model output can be interpreted using 
the same logic from example #1.
  
- **Model**: network SEIRD
- **Disease**: COVID-19    
- **% of population infected** = 0.1  
- **Probability of exposure** = 0.05  
- **Recovery probability** = 0.14  
- **Incubation days** = 7  
- **Simulation time** = 100  
- **Vaccine prevalence** = 70%
- **School closure prevalance** = 50%
- **Day of school closure implementation** = 7
- **Seed** = 2023  
  
## Running the model
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworldRShiny/assets/105825983/d5405162-f7fe-4a42-8a4c-e9a2ac31be73")
```
  
The above graphic demonstrates launching the application and running the model 
with COVID-19 as the disease. To modify the intervention parameters, scroll to 
the bottom of the application sidebar, select "interventions", and modify as 
desired. After running the simulation, plots of the distributions of states and 
the disease's reproductive number over time, a model summary, and table of each 
state's counts over time are all displayed.
  
## Results  
  
In this example, the model of choice is a SEIRD Network model. Notice the day of 
peak infections occurs on day 12, maxing out at 3,882 infections. Notice in 
the SEIRD model plot, there are very few exposed, infected, and deceased agents 
while the number of susceptible and recovered agents over the course of the 
simulation changes rapidly. Due to the vaccine, which decreases the probability 
of infection, and school closures which decrease the probability of exposure to 
COVID-19, there are a significantly decreased number of exposed, infected, and 
deceased agents.

## Comparison to absence of interventions 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
# library(cowplot)
# library(magick)
# ggdraw() + 
#   draw_image("~/Desktop/intervention.png", width = 0.5) + 
#   draw_image("~/Desktop/comparison_plot.png", width = 0.5, x = .5)

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworldRShiny/assets/105825983/092caa29-dee2-4230-b2c7-59a46a2493ee")

```

The above SEIRD model figures demonstrate the distribution of states over time 
both with and without interventions present (left and right figures 
respectively). With no measure to combat the spread of COVID-19, the number of 
exposed, infected, and deceased individuals greatly increase compared to the 
model with interventions. The peak number of infections occurs earlier, on day 
11, with a total of 17,616 infections at the peak, compared to 3,882 infections 
on day 12 with interventions present. This indicates that the vaccination and 
school closing measures were effective in reducing the number of infections and 
deaths in this simulated population.
